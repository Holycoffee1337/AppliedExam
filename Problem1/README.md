## Introduction
This project is about developing robust models for text classification on Amazon Review Data. The data can be found at "https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html". To replicate the approach that was taking doing the report, the json files for these categories are required:
    - Magazine_Subscriptions 
    - Clothing_Shoes_and_jewelry 
    - All_Beauty
    - Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing 
    - AMAZON_FASHION
    - Luxury_Beauty (Test data)
